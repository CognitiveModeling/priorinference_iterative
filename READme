This text file contains information about the files in this repository.

The folder "R" contains 2 files:
sRSA_iterative_dep.R
sRSA_iterative_indep_pr.R

These contain the implementation of the new iterative functions:
1. iterative function independent of trial order (prior rate not fixed)
2. iterative function dependent on trial order

These early implementation of these function can be found in the file: implementation_new iterative functions.R in the RSA_code repository under New_Branch_Yul --> RSA_2019_08 --> X9_code_with_package --> X9_new_iterative_functions.

To optimize the models from X9 you need to load the both of the packages:
priorinference and priorinferenceiterative package

This folder also contains the optimization files numbered from 1 to 4:
01. Data pre-processing
02. Optimization
    2a Optimization individual
    2b Optimization global
03. Model predictions
04. Scatter plots

All of the optimization files 01-04 are contained in the CognitiveModeling/priorinference_iterative repository.

The folder "optimized"" contains the outputs of the optimizations.
The folder "data" contains the raw data and the augmented data (output of the model predictions)
The folder "plots" contains the plots created with the scatter plot script.

The file "results_new_iterativOctober.Rmd" contains the results of the model predictions using the new iterative functions.
